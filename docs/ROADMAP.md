# HIAX AI-Friendly Roadmap 🤖

HIAX is designed to be more than just a programming language; it is a framework for building intelligent systems. Here is the plan for the next versions of HIAX.

## 1. Native AI Integration (`socho`)

We will introduce the `socho` (think) keyword to allow direct inference from within the language.

```hix
dhor result = socho("Analyze the sentiment", userInput);
```

## 2. Semantic Data Types

Support for vectors and embeddings as first-class citizens.

- **`vector` / `vichaar`**: A new type for high-dimensional data.
- **`cosine_similarity()`**: Built-in math for semantic comparison.

## 3. Agent-Oriented Programming

Introducing specialized class types for autonomous agents.

```hix
shreni Agent MyAssistant {
    system_prompt = "You are a helpful HIAX assistant";

    kaam execute(task) {
        iswa.respond(socho(task));
    }
}
```

## 4. Native Multi-lang Pre-processing

HIAX will include standard library features for:

- Hinglish to Devanagari transliteration.
- Automatic Unicode normalization.
- Tokenization optimization for LLMs.

## 5. Safe Execution Sandbox

HIAX scripts generated by AI can be executed in a restricted "Safe Mode":

- No raw disk access.
- Time-limited execution.
- Memory-capped process (preventing memory leaks).

## 6. Bilingual Standard Library

A full suite of data processing and networking tools in both English and Hindi/Assamese.

- `talika` (Table/DataFrames)
- `jaal` (Network/Web)
- `chitro` (Graphics/UI)
